- Look at Vercel function logs (Deployments â†’ Function Logs)

**UI looks broken?**
- Tailwind not compiling? Check build logs
- Missing lucide-react icons? npm install might have failed

**Deploy failing?**
- Check package.json is present
- Check all files are committed to git
- Check Vercel build logs for errors

## ðŸ“Š Usage Stats to Monitor

After launch, monitor:
- Anthropic API usage (console.anthropic.com)
- Vercel function invocations
- Average completion time per round
- Drop-off rates (localStorage leaderboard size vs unique visitors)

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Metrics

Good signs:
- Round 1 completion rate > 80%
- Round 2 completion rate > 60%  
- Round 3 attempts > 40%
- Average Round 3 score improving over time
- Low support tickets / error reports

## ðŸ’° Cost Expectations

Claude Sonnet 4 pricing:
- Input: $3 / million tokens
- Output: $15 / million tokens

Per Round 3 playthrough (~2300 tokens total): ~$0.05

Expected for 100 users/day:
- Daily: $5
- Monthly: $150
- Annual: $1,800

Vercel is free for hobby projects, or $20/month for Pro.

The game is designed to work out of the box - if something's not working, it's likely:
1. Missing environment variable
2. API key issue
3. Build error (check logs)
